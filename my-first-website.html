        <brli><a href="https://github.com/Theo-44/git-practice" target="_blank">Git-Practice</a><br>This project is solely based on improving my skills when it comes to working with git and git hub. PS: It kinda gets messy here than Jupiter's Atmosphere</br></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Theo-44/First-Webpage" target="_blank">First Webpage</a><br>You could say this is a bit similar to Hello World but with a more grown up feel to it. Development is on going</br></li>
