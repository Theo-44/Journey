    <h4>On my background: I am a Software Engineering Graduate from Kisii University. I have worked as IT Admin Manager at PKC Advocates for the last 3 years.</h4> 
    <p>I had this obsession with servers back in campus that kind of led me astray if am being honest, from coding and software development in coding. To be honest, I have always felt a void in not fully being able to code and it is something that has been gnawing at the back of my mind recently. When I saw this % week program by Moringa School on Software Development Prep I felt that this would be too good an opportunity to pass up and that's why I decided to enroll.</p>
    <h4><strong>Big ManUtd and Football fan, heavy on stats and little unknown match facts. Very ruthless when it comes to bantering other clubs. I am also quite invested in F1, the engineering and ingenuity involved is something that's absolutely remarkable and cements it as the pinnacle of Motorsport. Anything that's at Lower Earth Orbit and beyond excites me. PS: In Banter, Chess, Fifa, Math & Table Tennis I stay winning</strong></h4>
